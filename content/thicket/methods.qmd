## **How we mapped Thicket condition**

Accurately assessing ecological condition in the Albany Thicket biome presents a methodological challenge due not only to its structural heterogeneity, but also to the strong environmental gradients that shape Thicket physiognomy across its range. Strong east-west environmental gradients in rainfall, productivity and species composition mean that intact Thicket in the drier west is naturally much shorter, more open, and less evergreen than intact Thicket in the east (Vlok & Euston-Brown, 2002). As a result, vegetation that would be classified as severely degraded in the east may naturally resemble “intact” Thicket in the west. Solid, closed-canopy Thicket follows a well-documented, herbivore-driven degradation trajectory characterised by canopy collapse and transitions to pseudo-savanna states (Lloyd et al., 2002; Mills & Fey, 2004; Lechmere-Oertel et al., 2005; Lechmere-Oertel, 2023), whereas Thicket mosaics form natural bush clumps interspersed with low stature matrix vegetation, in ecotones with other biomes and thus patchy vegetation unrelated to degradation (Thompson et al., 2009; Carvalho & Campbell, 2021). There is still ongoing debate about whether these mosaics might have resulted from past overutilisation or natural vegetation gradients. Ideally, these structural differences would be treated using finer-scale community or sub-type maps. However, this level of spatial granularity is not feasible at a national scale within the SBAPP framework. Given these constraints, we extrapolated the solid-thicket condition models to the mosaic Thicket units where their ecological dynamics are sufficiently similar. Recognising that degradation signals are inherently more ambiguous in mosaic ecosystems, we explicitly quantify and map model uncertainty. These uncertainty layers allow users to identify areas where predictions in mosaics should be interpreted with caution, ensuring transparency about model limitations while still providing a coherent, biome-wide condition assessment.

## **Training data**

The SBAPP project views ecological condition as a continuum from transformed (habitat loss) to intact. Training data consisted of collated data set of condition-labelled points assigned through expert interpretation and known field-validated examples of Thicket in different states of ecological condition across the east-west environmental gradients. Training points were targeted in piospheres around artificial watering points with clear structural changes with browsing pressure, and along fence-line contrasts because these locations provide strong, unambiguous signals of herbivore-driven degradation. The close spatial pairing of fence-line contrasts reduces confounding environmental variability and increases the confidence that observed vegetation differences are primarily the result of land use history rather than underlying abiotic gradients (see e.g. Lechmere-Oertel et al., 2008). Transformed points were manually digitised in Google Earth Engine using the basemap. Points were classified into four condition classes: intact, moderate, severe, and transformed.

Ecological interpretation of the classes followed the state-and-transition framework used by Thompson et al. (2009) and Lechmere-Oertel (2023) as follows:

1\. Intact

Ecologically intact sites represent closed-canopy, structurally complete succulent/woody Thicket. These areas maintain the full complement of dominant woody species (e.g., *Portulacaria afra*, *Euclea undulata*, *Pappea capensis*), a deep litter layer, high aboveground biomass, and well-buffered microclimates. Soil surfaces are mostly shaded, erosion is minimal, and nutrient cycling remains functional. These sites correspond to the “untransformed” or “near-reference” state, showing no evidence of sustained herbivory-driven collapse.

2\. Moderate degradation

Moderately degraded Thicket exhibits partial canopy loss and early signs of structural simplification. Palatable shrubs decline but some Thicket clumps remain intact. The soil surface begins to experience intermittent exposure, ephemeral grasses, encroacher or invasiv shrubs increase in frequency, and the litter layer becomes discontinuous. This state aligns with the intermediate transition phase in Thompson et al. (2009)'s condition gradient, where degradation is evident but reversible if grazing pressure is reduced.

3\. Severe degradation

Severely degraded Thicket shows advanced canopy collapse, dominated by pseudo-savanna elements such as annual grasses, *Pentzia incana*, *Galenia* spp., and scattered remnant shrubs persisting only above the browse line. The original Thicket structure is largely lost, soil surfaces are exposed and crusted, and erosion scars are common. Nutrient cycling and microclimatic buffering have broken down. This corresponds to the high-degradation state of Thompson et al. (2009), where functional thresholds have been crossed and passive recovery is unlikely.

4\. Transformed

Transformed sites represent areas where Thicket has been completely removed by ploughing, orchards, croplands, urban development, mining, or other land-cover conversion. Ecologically, these areas no longer retain Thicket structure, species composition, or processes. In short, this class is where Thicket has lost habitat by direct human transformation.

## **Predictor variables**

Predictor variables were derived from the Google AlphaEarth Foundation satellite embeddings 10 m resolution annual dataset (available 2017-2024). Embeddings provide a way to compress large volumes of remote-sensing information into a compact set of features that may capture meaningful ecological and spatial patterns. The AlphaEarth Foundation Model integrates multi-temporal imagery from sensors such as Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 and Landsat, Land Cover data, elevation and learns a shared representation of the information contained across these sources (Brown et al., 2025). This allows each pixel’s spectral, spatial and temporal characteristics to be summarised in a small embedding vector of 64 values, that captures the key mutual information between the different sensors and the underlying landscape. Embedding values were sampled at each training point, which formed the input into a Random Forest model.

## **Random Forest modelling**

A supervised Random Forest (RF) regression model was trained separately for Arid, Valley, and Mesic Thicket using AlphaEarth embeddings as predictors and a continuous condition target derived from ordinal class labels in the training data. Ordinal class scores (0-1) were obtained by first applying Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression to the 64 embedding bands with ordered condition classes (transformed \< severe \< moderate \< intact) as the response, thereby extracting supervised components that capture the condition gradient (see e.g. Bell et al., 2021). The number of PLS components was chosen at the RMSEP “elbow” from cross-validation and used as predictors in an ordinal logistic (cumulative link) model (Mevik & Wehrens, 2024). The resulting latent condition axis was summarised per class and rescaled to 0-1 to produce data-driven numeric values for transformed, severe, moderate, and intact points (Bell et al., 2021). These values obtained using the pls package (Mevik & Wehrens, 2024) in R Statistical Software, were then used as the response for RF regression in GEE, enabling prediction of a continuous 0-1 ecological condition surface across each solid Thicket EFG. The numeric scaling facilitates downstream analyses, comparison across EFGs, and integration with condition frameworks such as the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (Criteria C & D) and SBAPP’s multi-pressure condition model, which both require a continuous measure of relative degradation intensity. The models were fitted using 300 trees with class-balanced sampling, applied to the embeddings for each the three solid EFGs. Outputs were clipped to the EFG boundaries to avoid extrapolation, and water bodies were masked using classes 14-21 in the SANLC 2022 dataset. The final condition gradient was exported at 10 m resolution for expert review.

## **Model validation** 

Model performance for the supervised Random Forest (RF) approach was evaluated using a combination of internal cross-validation and independent expert-mapped degradation maps. First, the condition-labelled points were randomly partitioned into an 80/20 train-test split, stratified by condition class to retain balanced representation of intact, moderate, severe and transformed sites. The model was trained on the 80% subset and predictions were evaluated against the held-out 20% using overall accuracy, class-specific precision and recall, and confusion matrices to quantify how well the RF distinguished different degradation states. To provide an external, ecologically independent assessment of model realism, we further validated predictions against farm-level degradation maps supplied by Thicket experts, mapped between 2020-2022, which contain spatially explicit delineations of moderate and severely degraded and intact areas. Points were randomly placed in areas that overlap with the expert-mapped polygons, where the RF predictions values were extracted, and agreement was assessed using mean predicted condition per polygon, class-wise accuracy, and visual consistency with known degradation patterns. This two-step validation of formal train-test evaluation complemented by expert-derived farm-scale benchmarks, ensured that the RF models not only performed well statistically, but also captured degradation patterns recognised by practitioners familiar with local Thicket dynamics.
