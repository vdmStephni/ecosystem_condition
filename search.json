    "section": "Key pressures in Thicket",
    "text": "Key pressures in Thicket\nThe degradation of Thicket has been ongoing for over a century. Historical accounts of vast areas of dense, thorny and impenetrable vegetation (Hoare et al., 2006; Reardon, 2021), other than along elephant paths, are rarely seen today. Other than outright habitat loss due to urban development and croplands, the replacement of indigenous megaherbivores (like elephants) with high densities of domestic stock has caused severe degradation of the natural landscapes (Lechmere-Oertel et al., 2005; Rutherford et al., 2014)​. Historical overstocking of livestock has thus likely been the primary driver of vegetation change in the arid parts of this biome over the past 200 years, outweighing natural climatic fluctuations (Thompson et al., 2009)​. Inside protected areas such as Addo Elephant National Park, browsing by elephants also impacts thicket structure (e.g. converting tall thicket to a shorter, more open state), but it is a more localised effect compared to the widespread clearing for citrus planting or unsustainable herbivory in rangelands. Outside these refuges, many thicket landscapes are in various stages of degradation, with reduced shrub or succulent cover, altered species composition, and diminished ecological function (lower carbon stocks and soil stability), often being indicators of degradation (van Luijk et al., 2013; Rutherford et al., 2014)​.\nIntact solid Thicket vegetation, i.e. untransformed and not in mosaics or bush clumps, is characterised by its resilience to certain disturbances, such as fire and herbivory, due to its dense near-impenetrable canopy and thorny structure (Vlok et al., 2003). However, this resilience comes at a cost: once disturbed, Thicket vegetation exhibits a low regenerative capacity, often failing to return to its original stable state or requiring decades for recovery of the slow-growing species (Lechmere-Oertel et al., 2005; Carvalho et al., 2022). This has significant implications for conservation, as the remaining intact Thicket needs to be prioritised for protection, and degraded sites actively restored where possible (Lechmere-Oertel, 2023). Indeed, restoration efforts in the Thicket has shown remarkable success when given space and time for recovery in protected sites (Mills & Cowling, 2006; del Rio-Mena et al., 2021; Galuszynski, 2023). The Thicket biome faces increasing pressure from anthropogenic activities, particularly overgrazing/browsing by livestock such as goats or extralimital game species, which has led to severe degradation, such as loss of key plant species and canopy cover, increasing grass cover and soil erosion in many areas (Lechmere-Oertel, 2023). A recent study found that structural changes to Arid Thicket are linked to functional changes to new vegetation states with differing herbivory regimes (Schmidt & Kerley, 2024). Soil erosion, largely driven by unsustainable herbivory, contributes to the loss of topsoil and further diminishes the ecological integrity of these areas by reducing regenerative capacity (Lechmere-Oertel et al., 2005), ultimately resulting in carbon loss (Mills & Cowling, 2006). Invasive alien species, such as Opuntia species and Australian wattles, further exacerbate this degradation by outcompeting native vegetation and changing ecosystem processes through altered nutrient cycling, hydrology and fire regimes (Veldtman et al., 2010; Kraaij et al., 2022). Additionally, climate change poses a long-term threat to the Thicket biome, with shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns potentially altering the distribution and composition of vegetation, as climatic niches shift. Droughts in particular are predicted to increase in South Africa, and pose a major threat to the ecological condition of Thicket. These change drivers interact in complex ways, often exacerbating the impacts on Thicket ecosystems and making conservation and restoration efforts more challenging (Lloyd et al. 2002). However, understanding and mitigating these drivers are crucial for preserving the ecological integrity of Thicket vegetation."

Quality is assessed with respect to ecosystem structure, function and composition, which underpin the ecological integrity of the ecosystem”. In practice, remote sensing is currently strongest for detecting structure and function (e.g., cover, biomass proxies, phenology, productivity), while composition usually needs field data and expert interpretation to anchor the remote-sensing signals.\nCondition is interpreted as a continuum from intact to transformed, rather than a set of rigid categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: condition is ecosystem-specific\n\n\n\nA “low NDVI” pixel is not automatically degraded—it might be naturally open, seasonal, or disturbance-driven. That’s why we start with ecosystem units and local ecological expertise before selecting metrics."

Strong east-west environmental gradients in rainfall, productivity and species composition mean that intact Thicket in the drier west is naturally much shorter, more open, and less evergreen than intact Thicket in the east (Vlok & Euston-Brown, 2002). As a result, vegetation that would be classified as severely degraded in the east may naturally resemble “intact” Thicket in the west. Solid, closed-canopy Thicket follows a well-documented, herbivore-driven degradation trajectory characterised by canopy collapse and transitions to pseudo-savanna states (Lloyd et al., 2002; Mills & Fey, 2004; Lechmere-Oertel et al., 2005; Lechmere-Oertel, 2023), whereas Thicket mosaics form natural bush clumps interspersed with low stature matrix vegetation, in ecotones with other biomes and thus patchy vegetation unrelated to degradation (Thompson et al., 2009; Carvalho & Campbell, 2021).

    "section": "Training data",
    "text": "Training data\nThe SBAPP project views ecological condition as a continuum from transformed (habitat loss) to intact. Training data consisted of collated data set of condition-labelled points assigned through expert interpretation and known field-validated examples of Thicket in different states of ecological condition across the east-west environmental gradients. Training points were targeted in piospheres around artificial watering points with clear structural changes with browsing pressure, and along fence-line contrasts because these locations provide strong, unambiguous signals of herbivore-driven degradation. The close spatial pairing of fence-line contrasts reduces confounding environmental variability and increases the confidence that observed vegetation differences are primarily the result of land use history rather than underlying abiotic gradients (see e.g. Lechmere-Oertel et al., 2008). Transformed points were manually digitised in Google Earth Engine using the basemap. Points were classified into four condition classes: intact, moderate, severe, and transformed.\nEcological interpretation of the classes followed the state-and-transition framework used by Thompson et al. (2009) and Lechmere-Oertel (2023) as follows:\n1. Intact\nEcologically intact sites represent closed-canopy, structurally complete succulent/woody Thicket. These areas maintain the full complement of dominant woody species (e.g., Portulacaria afra, Euclea undulata, Pappea capensis), a deep litter layer, high aboveground biomass, and well-buffered microclimates. Soil surfaces are mostly shaded, erosion is minimal, and nutrient cycling remains functional. These sites correspond to the “untransformed” or “near-reference” state, showing no evidence of sustained herbivory-driven collapse.\n2. Moderate degradation\nModerately degraded Thicket exhibits partial canopy loss and early signs of structural simplification. Palatable shrubs decline but some Thicket clumps remain intact. The soil surface begins to experience intermittent exposure, ephemeral grasses, encroacher or invasiv shrubs increase in frequency, and the litter layer becomes discontinuous. This state aligns with the intermediate transition phase in Thompson et al. (2009)’s condition gradient, where degradation is evident but reversible if grazing pressure is reduced.\n3. Severe degradation\nSeverely degraded Thicket shows advanced canopy collapse, dominated by pseudo-savanna elements such as annual grasses, Pentzia incana, Galenia spp., and scattered remnant shrubs persisting only above the browse line. The original Thicket structure is largely lost, soil surfaces are exposed and crusted, and erosion scars are common. Nutrient cycling and microclimatic buffering have broken down. This corresponds to the high-degradation state of Thompson et al. (2009), where functional thresholds have been crossed and passive recovery is unlikely.\n4. Transformed\nTransformed sites represent areas where Thicket has been completely removed by ploughing, orchards, croplands, urban development, mining, or other land-cover conversion. Ecologically, these areas no longer retain Thicket structure, species composition, or processes. In short, this class is where Thicket has lost habitat by direct human transformation."

The AlphaEarth Foundation Model integrates multi-temporal imagery from sensors such as Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 and Landsat, Land Cover data, elevation and learns a shared representation of the information contained across these sources (Brown et al., 2025). This allows each pixel’s spectral, spatial and temporal characteristics to be summarised in a small embedding vector of 64 values, that captures the key mutual information between the different sensors and the underlying landscape.

Ordinal class scores (0-1) were obtained by first applying Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression to the 64 embedding bands with ordered condition classes (transformed &lt; severe &lt; moderate &lt; intact) as the response, thereby extracting supervised components that capture the condition gradient (see e.g. Bell et al., 2021). The number of PLS components was chosen at the RMSEP “elbow” from cross-validation and used as predictors in an ordinal logistic (cumulative link) model (Mevik & Wehrens, 2024). The resulting latent condition axis was summarised per class and rescaled to 0-1 to produce data-driven numeric values for transformed, severe, moderate, and intact points (Bell et al., 2021). These values obtained using the pls package (Mevik & Wehrens, 2024) in R Statistical Software, were then used as the response for RF regression in GEE, enabling prediction of a continuous 0-1 ecological condition surface across each solid Thicket EFG. The numeric scaling facilitates downstream analyses, comparison across EFGs, and integration with condition frameworks such as the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (Criteria C & D) and SBAPP’s multi-pressure condition model, which both require a continuous measure of relative degradation intensity. The models were fitted using 300 trees with class-balanced sampling, applied to the embeddings for each the three solid EFGs. Outputs were clipped to the EFG boundaries to avoid extrapolation, and water bodies were masked using classes 14-21 in the SANLC 2022 dataset. The final condition gradient was exported at 10 m resolution for expert review."

The model was trained on the 80% subset and predictions were evaluated against the held-out 20% using overall accuracy, class-specific precision and recall, and confusion matrices to quantify how well the RF distinguished different degradation states. To provide an external, ecologically independent assessment of model realism, we further validated predictions against farm-level degradation maps supplied by Thicket experts, mapped between 2020-2022, which contain spatially explicit delineations of moderate and severely degraded and intact areas. Points were randomly placed in areas that overlap with the expert-mapped polygons, where the RF predictions values were extracted, and agreement was assessed using mean predicted condition per polygon, class-wise accuracy, and visual consistency with known degradation patterns. This two-step validation of formal train-test evaluation complemented by expert-derived farm-scale benchmarks, ensured that the RF models not only performed well statistically, but also captured degradation patterns recognised by practitioners familiar with local Thicket dynamics."

    "text": "The general workflow\n\nStep 1 — Define assessment units and identify relevant experts\nChoose ecologically meaningful units (e.g., ecosystem types or functional groups) and involve experts who can co-define reference condition, key pressures, and interpret indicators.\nEffective condition assessments require maps of the ecosystem extent to select units of assessments. Defining these units a priori is critical because they serve two purposes in the assessment: (1) they provide a consistent framework to delineate and describe the area of interest, and (2) they form the basis for interpreting ecological metrics in a meaningful way. The defined units should not span functionally dissimilar ecosystems, as it can obscure degradation patterns. In South Africa, the National Vegetation Map (NVM) is used as the primary terrestrial ecosystem typology and map, which classified South Africa’s diverse vegetation hierarchically into vegetation types nested within vegetation units, bioregions and nine biomes (Mucina and Rutherford, 2006). The NVM is iteratively updated and refined (Dayaram et al., 2019), and serves as a representation of the potential extent of vegetation types (pre-1750), providing a foundation for understanding the form and function of South African landscapes and its ecological processes, and a baseline for detecting ecological change (Dayaram et al., 2019). The vegetation types in the NVM (Mucina & Rutherford, 2006; Dayaram et al. in prep) are used interchangeably as ecosystem types, since vegetation types were classified not only based on floristics but also abiotic conditions, such as geology, soil type and climate. These ecosystem types can intuitively be cross-referenced to the GET ecosystem types (Keith et al., 2020) with ecosystems being nested within broader-level biomes that correspond to specific geographic space. For countries without a national ecosystem classification system, the GET provides an ideal starting point as the typology for this workflow (see e.g. Wells et al., 2025), although the accompanying map, the Global Ecosystem Atlas, is not available for all countries yet.\n\n\nStep 2 — Identify key pressures and change pathways\nScreen threats and agree on the main pressures that plausibly drive degradation in the unit (e.g., unsustainable herbivory, bush encroachment, invasive plants, altered fire regimes, erosion). This step should produce a shared conceptual model of “what changes when the ecosystem degrades?”.\n\n\nStep 3 — Define a reference condition\nDefine what “intact” (or benchmark) condition means for the unit, ideally across natural variability (seasonality, disturbance/recovery cycles, rainfall gradients). Reference sites should be documented and defensible.\n\n\nStep 4 — Select ecosystem-specific indicators of condition\nTranslate ecological understanding into measurable indicators (structure/function and—where feasible—composition). Indicators should be linked to the pressures in Step 2 and be interpretable to end users.\n\n\nStep 5 — Choose remote-sensing metrics and data sources\nSelect satellite/sensor data and metrics that are capable of detecting the chosen indicators at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Time-series and phenology-based measures are often essential in seasonal systems.\n\n\nStep 6 — Set thresholds (if discrete classes are needed)\nEven if condition is mapped continuously, many applications require severity classes (e.g., intact / moderate / severe). Thresholds should be guided by the metric distributions, expert definitions, and (where available) state-and-transition understanding.\n\n\nStep 7 — Produce maps and validate (iteratively)\nGenerate spatial outputs, validate against field/expert evidence, quantify uncertainty, and iterate with expert review until the product is ecologically defensible. Outputs can be continuous (0–1) or categorical depending on the use case."

This is powerful in heterogeneous landscapes but needs careful validation and uncertainty reporting.\n\n\nBoth approaches can be appropriate; we generally choose based on data availability, the ecosystem, pressure signals, training data availability, and interpretability requirements."

We prefer time-series and phenology metrics and interpret everything relative to reference expectations.\nUnit definition matters: if the ecosystem unit is mapped too broadly, condition signals get blurred. We document the chosen units and revise if experts disagree.\nRemote sensing is proxy-based: we lean heavily on expert interpretation and transparent assumptions, and we treat uncertainty as a first-class output."
